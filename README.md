<p>This site, <a href="http://dt727.com" target='_blank'>dt727.com</a>, is hosted through GitHub Pages and is the personal website for Daryl Umberger (dt727).</p>
<h1>Creator</h1>
<p>Daryl Umberger works as a Web Content Specialist at Geographic Solutions, in Palm Harbor, FL, since May 2012.</p> 
<p>This personal site is a stab at developing a larger portfolio so that it might help me move into a position as a Web Developer. Daryl Umberger began his career as a reporter, and thus has been continually developing his coding skills as ongoing penance for not starting out in Tech.</p>
